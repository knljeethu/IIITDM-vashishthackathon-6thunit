TITLE: Automated Road Damage Detection for Infrastructure Maintenance                                            
DESCRIPTION:  
    Manual inspection of road conditions is a time-consuming and labor-intensive
 task, leading to delays in identifying and repairing damaged roads. The goal is to
 develop a classification model capable of automatically detecting and
 categorizing road damage from images (captured through CC
 cameras,phone,etc.), in order to make the maintenance process efficient. The
 infrastructure management is enhanced by reducing the reliance on manual
 inspections and enabling timely and targeted repairs to ensure safe and
 well-maintained road networks.
OBJECTIVE:
 ● Thedataset has images of roads with background. The model should
 involve object detection to capture only roads (using YOLO or R-CNN or
 their combination,etc.), followed by classifying the damaged roads.
 Brownie points:
 ● Deploy the model (using Firebase)
 ● Viewreal-time road damage alerts generated by the model.
 Evaluation Metric: Intersection over Union (IoU)
